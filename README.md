# Dog Party 2.0 (Positioning is Ruff)

## Objective and Purpose

The objective of my first project at Turing is to build out a UI for a website based on a comp provided by a designer. Using the Sublime text editor, an index.html file is to be linked to two separate style sheets and a single JavaScript file. Unfortunately using CSS flex-box or grid for this project is not allowed, resulting in repeated banging my head against the table. 

## Process

The first day I got the project I was ecstatic to get home and get it a shot. So I get home and start with just HTML, no CSS. So I knock out the HTML in no time, but only using div to break up my sections. The second day I realized that using HTML5 semantic elements would be considerably easier and cleaner to look at. That day I knocked out the HTML and CSS, with minor alignment issues in my nav bar (getting it to float right in my header). I typically stay away from floats if I can but I got it to function properly with good aesthetics. Another problem I had was fonts. I had never used google fonts and didn't realize you need to link to the italic and bold versions of a font as well. Most issues though were easily Googleable or I could find examples similar enough in HTML and CSS by Jon Duckett.
